Welcome to the Nonogram Bot!
========================================

Nonograms are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden pixel art-like picture. 

We are making a computer program that solves the Nonogram via the hints the user inputs.
